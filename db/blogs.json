      "post": "In the first week of starting school we’ve covered these three basic topics HTML, CSS and GIT. CSS is one of the topic I still struggle with. Whether it is identifying selector to add CSS to the correct tag/attribute or knowing what kind/types of elements to use to get to the desired result. After working on my first assignment I’ve realized that CSS is trial and error for me – by knowing what to research/google the end goal can be achieved. All the topics covered last week have their own interesting things,however what stood the most for me was Git/Github – I found this to be very interesting due to the fact that it makes collaboration so much easier and meaningful. It also can be considered as an encyclopedia of code where large number of codes exist in it that are used to build software.As much as I enjoy my time at NSS – something I didn’t know/realize before is how to manage my time wisely. With all the assignments and life going on I feel like I need to take a class that teaches “How to manage your time wisely”."

      "post": "Ready or not here comes <strong>JavaScript</strong> – JS has been a bit challenging to me. I am still wrapping my head around Arrays, For loops, Objects and Functions. Even though I feel like the class is going fast I’m trying to take it slow and learn one thing at a time. I am sure that I will get better at solving any kind of Javascript problem but I still need to do a lot of practicing and reading. The Js Array challenge was the most difficult for me this week trying to figure out how to go about solving the problem."

      "post": "Advance array method was one of the topic covered on this week’s lesson. Once I get the hang of it I am positive that I will be grateful for these methods but with my current state not quite there yet but will definitely be soon. We also covered how team mates work in one project from beginning to end. Coming up with ideas on how to design the web page, listing what kind of data is needed and assigning tickets for each task. Went over free framework tools and how to use them – found this one to be very interesting – where the frame work tool we used can be shared and at the same be edited by different team mates makes collaboration so easy."

      "post": "In the past weeks was the first git project we had as a group. We were instructed to build a band website with different pages linking to the home page so each of my group members were working on one page but we could only use one js file which led to git conflict when we tried to merge to master. I can say I learned quite a lot about git incidents from this exercise and how to resolve the conflicts. After completing the group assignments, we learned ES6 which looks kind of fancy and easy but a tiny bit confusing, I guess the confusion part won’t stay for long. We also covered interacting and traversing in DOM which I believe is the biggest part of JS to make a web page interactive."

    "post": "Task Runners and Browserify are the topics we covered this week. The confusing part for me is where we are requiring and exporting. Before browsify we did all the code in one main.js file, now we have everything in a different js files and we require and export the functions on the other files...hmmm its a bit confusing but i believe that it will be easier once i get the hang of it."

Eventhough I get irritated when grunt yells at me when I make errors I like the fact that its keeping my code clean and neat. I still need to work more on understanding the circular dependency issues and how to solve the function related errors the grunt throws out."

    "post": "On this week we we were given to build a chatty app that has different features and present it in  class. I always learn a lot from group projects from my team mates. We planned each and every step thoroughly  and discussed all the steps in detail.The project was a success due to the throw planning and good communication. Everybody was helpful with any questions i had and i've learned a lot from each of my team members.I want to say the best lesson i had was to plan each and every step clearly and precisely which i kinda dont do often.i also like listening to different ideas and how everybody has their own way of solving a problem or tackling a task. Eventhough i wanted to challenge myself by working on something i haven't done most of them were already taken but i still learned a lot from the codes they did and am sure those will come in handy."

    "post": "Finally we started Jquery!!! When i took the pre-work on tree house the easiest part for me was jquery it made javascript easier - so i was excited that we started jquery this week and will be using it moving forward. I would still need to do a lot of practicing and studying. The other thing i like most about it is the documentation part which makes googling easier.The creator did an awesome job in making sure that not only people can use jquery but it well documented. I like it!"
